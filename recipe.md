1. To make a curry paste, blend together the 3 red finger chillies, 1/2 of the ground coriander, the cumin, turmeric, garlic, ginger and tamarind paste until smooth, using either a food processor or pestle and mortar.

2. Cut the pollock fillets into halves (or chunky pieces if really large), then season well with salt and pepper.

3. Heat the oil to medium/high in a deep frying pan, add the onion and fry for about 5 minutes, until golden brown. Then add the split chillies, curry paste, the other 1/2 of the ground coriander and a little more oil if necessary, slowly stirring everything together.

4. Mix in the tomato and fry for 1 minute, then add the coconut milk and season with more salt and pepper before reducing the heat.

5. Add the fish to the pan, cover and simmer gently over a medium heat for about 5-6 minutes, turning the fish over half-way through. Add the fresh coriander and season again with salt and pepper.

6. Serve in bowls with boiled rice and naan bread as sides.
